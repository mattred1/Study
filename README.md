# Watch me learn!
As I go through [Colt Steele's Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp class](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), I thought it would be helpful to document everything I'm learning.

I don't add my notes here, but I try to add more of the interesting exercises in the course here for easy access.
